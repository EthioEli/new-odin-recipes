<p>This one is a Vegan take on Mac and Cheese! It has cashews, coconut milk, and nutritional yeast to match the cheesey taste and consistancy of Mac and Cheese.</p>

<h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>

<ul>
    <li>1 pound elbow macaroni</li>
    <li>1 cup 1/2-inch diced Yukon gold potato (from about 1 medium)</li>
    <li>1/2 cup 1-inch diced onion (from about 1/2 medium)</li>
    <li>1/2 cup 1/2-inch diced butternut squash</li>
    <li>1/2 cup raw cashews</li>
    <li>1/3 cup coconut milk</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons nutritional yeast</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon paprika</li>
    <li>1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
    <li>Juice of 1/2 lemon </li>
    <li>Kosher salt</li>
</ul>

<h3>STEPS</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Cook the pasta according to the package directions for al dente. </li>
    <li>Meanwhile, combine the potato, onion and squash in a medium saucepan and cover with water by 1 inch. Bring to a boil and cook until the potato and squash are tender and cooked through, about 8 minutes. </li>
    <li>Add the cashews, coconut milk, nutritional yeast, garlic powder, paprika, cayenne, lemon juice and 1 teaspoon salt to a blender along with the cooked vegetables and 1/2 cup of the cooking liquid. Blend until the sauce has the consistency of thick pancake batter; you may need add up to 1/4 cup more of the cooking liquid if your sauce is too thick.</li>
    <li>Toss the sauce with the pasta in a large bowl while still hot.</li>
</ol>
